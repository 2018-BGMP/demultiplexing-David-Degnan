b. What is a good quality score cutoff for index reads and pairs to utilize for sample
identification and downstream analysis, respectively?

Since the lowest average quality score was 30, I believe 25 is a good quality score
cutoff value (which is approximately 3 errors for every 1000 bases). This value is 
supported by literature (Johnson and Slatkin 2006).

c. How many indexes have Undetermined (N) base calls? (Utilize your command line
tool knowledge. Submit the command you used. CHALLENGE: use a one-line command)

File_Name	Index	#_undertermined_base_calls
1294_S1_L008_R1_002.fastq.gz	index1	3976613
1294_S1_L008_R1_003.fastq.gz	index2	3328051

**Commands for Unix** 
zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -E "N" | wc -l 
zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -E "N" | wc -l 

**Challenge**
zcat 1294_S1_L008_R[2,3]* | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -E "N" | wc -l
